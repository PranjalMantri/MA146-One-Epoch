# Automation in Security Surveillance using AI/ML

## Team: One Epoch

Welcome to our hackathon project! This project aims to enhance security surveillance by utilizing AI/ML technologies to detect unusual activities in real-time. Our system integrates a backend server, a Flutter app, and a web detection module to ensure comprehensive monitoring and alerting.

## Project Structure

- **Backend Server (Flask)**
- **Flutter App**
- **Web Detection (Flask)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flutter SDK
- Required Python packages 

### Running the Backend Server

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd flask-backend
    ```
2. **Run the Flask backend server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### Running the Flutter App

1. **Navigate to the Flutter app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd plexis
    ```
2. **Run the Flutter app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Running the Threat Detection Web

1. **Navigate to the web detection directory:**
    ```bash
    cd web-detection
    ```
    ```
2. **Run the web detection backend:**
    ```bash
    python detect.py
    ```

## Project Features

- **Real-time Activity Detection:** Our system monitors live video feeds and detects any unusual activities using machine learning algorithms.
- **Cross-platform Monitoring:** Access live feeds and alerts through both mobile and web applications.
- **Automated Alerts:** Receive instant notifications on detected anomalies to ensure prompt responses.
